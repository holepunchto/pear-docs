# Making a Pear Terminal Application

This guide demonstrates how to build a peer-to-peer chat application.

It continues where [Starting a Pear Terminal Project](./starting-a-pear-terminal-project.md) left off.

## Step 1. Install modules

For the chat part of the app, the same modules are needed as in [Making a Pear Desktop Application](./making-a-pear-desktop-app.md), `hyperswarm`, `b4a` and  `hypercore-crypto`.

Pear runs on [`Bare`](https://github.com/holepunchto/bare), a lightweight JavaScript runtime which is similar to Node.js but comes with very few internal modules. Almost all Bare functionality comes from dependencies. Pear Terminal Applications are Bare applications so we will need `bare-readline` and `bare-tty` to read user input.


```
npm i bare-readline bare-tty hyperswarm b4a hypercore-crypto
```

## Step 2. JavaScript

Replace `index.js` with

``` js
import Hyperswarm from 'hyperswarm'
import b4a from 'b4a'
import crypto from 'hypercore-crypto'
import readline from 'bare-readline'
import tty from 'bare-tty'

const { teardown, config } = Pear
const key = config.args.pop()
const shouldCreateSwarm = !key
const swarm = new Hyperswarm()
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: new tty.ReadStream(0),
  output: new tty.WriteStream(1)
})

swarm.on('connection', peer => {
  const name = b4a.toString(peer.remotePublicKey, 'hex').substr(0, 6)
  console.log(`[info] New peer joined, ${name}`)
  peer.on('data', message => appendMessage({ name, message }))
})
swarm.on('update', () => {
  console.log(`[info] Number of connections is now ${swarm.connections.size}`)
})

if (shouldCreateSwarm) {
  await createChatRoom()
} else {
  await joinChatRoom(key)
}

rl.input.setMode(tty.constants.MODE_RAW)
rl.on('data', line => {
  sendMessage(line)
  rl.prompt()
})
rl.prompt()

async function createChatRoom () {
  const topicBuffer = crypto.randomBytes(32)
  await joinSwarm(topicBuffer)
  const topic = b4a.toString(topicBuffer, 'hex')
  console.log(`[info] Created new chat room: ${topic}`)
}

async function joinChatRoom (topicStr) {
  const topicBuffer = b4a.from(topicStr, 'hex')
  await joinSwarm(topicBuffer)
  console.log(`[info] Joined chat room`)
}

async function joinSwarm (topicBuffer) {
  const discovery = swarm.join(topicBuffer, { client: true, server: true })
  await discovery.flushed()
}

function sendMessage (message) {
  const peers = [...swarm.connections]
  for (const peer of peers) peer.write(message)
}

function appendMessage ({ name, message }) {
  console.log(`[${name}] ${message}`)
}
```

## Step 3. Run in dev mode

To test this chat app, in one terminal run `pear dev .`

The app will output something similar to:

```
[info] Created new chat room: a1b2c35fbeb452bc900c5a1c00306e52319a3159317312f54fe5a246d634f51a
```

In another terminal use this key as input, `pear dev . a1b2c35fbeb452bc900c5a1c00306e52319a3159317312f54fe5a246d634f51a`

The app will output:

```
[info] Number of connections is now 0
[info] New peer joined, 6193ec
[info] Number of connections is now 1
[info] Joined chat room
```

Type something in one of the applications. Two Terminal Applications are now connected peer-to-peer.
