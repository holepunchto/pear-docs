# How to connect two Peers by key with Hyperdht

[`Hyperswarm`](../building-blocks/hyperswarm.md) helps to find and connect to peers who are announcing a common 'topic'. The swarm topic can be anything. The HyperDHT uses a series of holepunching techniques to establish direct connections between peers, even if they're located on home networks with tricky NATs.

In the HyperDHT, peers are identified by a public key, not by an IP address. With the public key, users can connect to each other irrespective of their location, even if they move between different networks.

> Hyperswarm's holepunching will fail if both the client peer and the server peer are on randomizing [NATs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation), in which case the connection must be relayed through a third peer. Hyperswarm does not do any relaying by default.

> For example, Keet implements its relaying system wherein other call participants can serve as relays -- the more participants in the call, the stronger overall connectivity becomes.

Use the HyperDHT to create a basic CLI chat app where a client peer connects to a server peer by public key. 

This example consists of two applications: `client-app` and `server-app`.

The `server-app` will create a key pair and then start a server that will listen on the generated key pair. The public key is logged into the console. Copy it for instantiating the client.

Create the `server-app` project with the following commands:

```
mkdir server-app
cd server-app
pear init -y -t terminal
npm install hyperdht b4a bare-process
```

Alter `server-app/index.js` to the following:

```javascript
import DHT from 'hyperdht'
import b4a from 'b4a'
import process from 'bare-process'

const dht = new DHT()

// This keypair is the peer identifier in the DHT
const keyPair = DHT.keyPair()

const server = dht.createServer(conn => {
  console.log('got connection!')
  process.stdin.pipe(conn).pipe(process.stdout)
})

server.listen(keyPair).then(() => {
  console.log('listening on:', b4a.toString(keyPair.publicKey, 'hex'))
})

// Unnannounce the public key before exiting the process
// (This is not a requirement, but it helps avoid DHT pollution)
Pear.teardown(() => server.close())
```

Open the `server-app` with `pear dev`.

Create the `client-app` project with the following commands:

```
mkdir client-app
cd client-app
pear init -y -t terminal
npm install hyperdht b4a bare-process
```
Alter `client-app/index.js` to the following:

``` javascript
import DHT from 'hyperdht'
import b4a from 'b4a'
import process from 'bare-process'

console.log('Connecting to:', process.argv[3])
const publicKey = b4a.from(process.argv[3], 'hex')

const dht = new DHT()
const conn = dht.connect(publicKey)
conn.once('open', () => console.log('got connection!'))

process.stdin.pipe(conn).pipe(process.stdout)
```

Pass the key to the client:

```
cd client-app
pear dev -- <SUPPLY KEY HERE>
```

The `client-app` will spin up a client, and the public key copied earlier must be supplied as a command line argument for connecting to the server. The client process will log `got connection` into the console when it connects to the server.

Once it's connected, try typing in both terminals.
