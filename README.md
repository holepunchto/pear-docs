## Stability indexing

Throughout the documentation, indications of stability are provided. Some modules are well-established and used widely, making them highly unlikely to ever change. Other modules may be new, experimental, or known to have risks associated with their use.

The following stability indices have been used:

|                           Stability                          |                         Description                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------: |
|    <mark style="background-color: #80ff80;">**stable**</mark>   | Unlikely to change or be removed in the foreseeable future. |
| <mark style="background-color: #8484ff;">**experimental**</mark> |             New, untested, or have known issues.            |
| <mark style="background-color: #ffffa2;">**deprecated**</mark> |           Being removed or replaced in the future.          |
|    <mark style="background-color: #ff4242;">**unstable**</mark>   |          May change or be removed without warning.          |
