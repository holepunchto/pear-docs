### Pear <a name="pear"></a>

Pear is a native peer-to-peer capable platform that consists of a runtime binary, an API, userland modules, a command-line interface, an on-demand daemon and an application shell to provide the capabilities to develop & deploy production peer-to-peer applications. With JavaScript and beyond.

### Bare <a name="bare"></a>

Pear is built on [Bare](https://github.com/holepunchto/bare), a small and modular JavaScript runtime for desktop and mobile. Like Node.js, it provides an asynchronous, event-driven architecture for writing applications in the lingua franca of modern software. Unlike Node.js, it makes embedding and cross-device support core use cases, aiming to run just as well on your phone as on your laptop.

### Stability Legend <a name="stability-legend"></a>

Throughout the documentation, indications of stability are provided. Some modules are well-established and used widely, making them highly unlikely to ever change. Other modules may be new, experimental, or known to have risks associated with their use.

The following stability indices have been used:

|                           Stability                          |                         Description                         |
