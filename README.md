# Pear by Holepunch

> Pear loads applications remotely from peers and allows anyone to create and share applications with peers.

Pear by Holepunch is a combined Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Runtime, Development & Deployment tool.

Build, share & extend unstoppable, zero-infrastructure P2P applications for Desktop, Terminal & Mobile.

Welcome to the Internet of Peers

## How-tos

Simple How-tos on using the essential builing blocks in P2P applications using.

* [How to connect to many peers by topic with Hyperswarm](./howto/connect-to-many-peers-by-topic-with-hyperswarm.md)

## Helpers

Helper modules can be used together with the building blocks to create cutting-edge P2P tools and applications.

* [`corestore`](./helpers/corestore.md): A Hypercore factory designed to facilitate the management of sizable named Hypercore collections.
* [`localdrive`](./helpers/localdrive.md): A file system interoperable with Hyperdrive.
* [`mirrordrive`](./helpers/mirrordrive.md): Mirror a [`hyperdrive`](./building-blocks/hyperdrive.md) or a [`localdrive`](./helpers/localdrive.md) into another one.
* [`secretstream`](./helpers/secretstream.md): SecretStream is used to securely create connections between two peers in Hyperswarm.
* [`compact-encoding`](./helpers/compact-encoding.md): A series of binary encoding schemes for building fast and small parsers and serializers. We use this in Keet to store chat messages and in Hypercore's replication protocol.
* [`protomux`](./helpers/protomux.md): Multiplex multiple message oriented protocols over a stream.

## Tools

The following tools are used extensively employed in the day-to-day development and operation of applications built on Pear.

## Apps

Applications built using Pear. 

- [Keet](./apps/keet.md) - A peer-to-peer chat and video-conferencing application with end-to-end encryption.

## Stability indexing

Throughout the documentation, indications of stability are provided. Some modules are well-established and used widely, making them highly unlikely to ever change. Other modules may be new, experimental, or known to have risks associated with their use.

The following stability indices have been used:

|                           Stability                          |                         Description                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------: |
|    <mark style="background-color: #80ff80;">**stable**</mark>   | Unlikely to change or be removed in the foreseeable future. |
| <mark style="background-color: #8484ff;">**experimental**</mark> |             New, untested, or have known issues.            |
| <mark style="background-color: #ffffa2;">**deprecated**</mark> |           Being removed or replaced in the future.          |
|    <mark style="background-color: #ff4242;">**unstable**</mark>   |          May change or be removed without warning.          |
