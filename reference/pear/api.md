# Application Programming Interface (API)

<mark style="background-color: #8484ff;">**experimental**</mark>

The Pear API enables applications to interact with Pear platform features.

Most application peer-to-peer functionality is provided by ecosystem modules rather than the API.

Platform APIs are unchangeable. Compatibility cannot break. So the Pear API surface aims to be (and remain)
as small as possible.

## `global.Pear`

The Pear Platform API is made available globally as `Pear`.

The `Pear` API is designed to be small and immutable.

Any future changes to the `Pear` API will be non-breaking additions.

## `Pear.config <Object>`

Contains application configuration data.

### `Pear.config.key <Object|null>`

The `config.key` object holds both Hexadecimal and Z-Base-32 encodings of the key, and is of the form `{ z32: <String>, hex: <String> }`,

### `Pear.config.dev <Boolean>`

Whether the application is in development mode.

### `Pear.config.tier <String>`

## Pear.messages([ pattern ], [ listener ]) -> Iterable

A function which accepts a pattern object and returns an [`Iambus`](https://github.com/holepunchto/iambus) subscriber (which inherits from [`streamx`](https://github.com/mafintosh/streamx) `Readable`) which emits message objects matching a provided pattern object.

If no pattern object or an empty pattern object is provided all messages will be emitted. A pattern object is an object (typically) containing a subset of matching values for a given target object. Message objects can be user generated or platform generated.

The subscriber stream has a `data` event which can be listened to, it can also be consumed with `for await` and an listener function can be passed in addition to pattern (`message(pattern, listener)`) or as a single argument (`messages(listener)`) (indicating a catch-all pattern).

A message object may have any properties. Platform-generated messages are given a `type` property.

### Examples:

Listen for an internal platform message using a pattern object and listener function:

```js
const { messages } = Pear

messages({ type: 'pear/wakeup' }, ({ data, link }) => {
  console.log('pear/wakeup', data, link)
})
```

Tiny utility module which logs all messages using `for await`:

```js
const { messages } = Pear

for await (const message of messages()) {
  if (global.LOGBUS) console.log('BUS:', message)
}
```

Use `message` to create an application message:

```js
const { message, messages } = Pear

const ctaClicks = messages({ type: 'my-app/user-cta' })

ctaClicks.on('data', (msg) => { console.log('cta click', msg) })

// elsewhere
onUserClickCta((event, data) => {
  message({ type: 'my-app/user-cta', event, data })
})
```

## `await Pear.message(<Object>)`

Send a message which will be:

```js
const { message, messages } = Pear

async function logMessages () {
  for await (const message of messages()) console.log(message)
}

logMessages().catch(console.error)

let count = 0
do {
  await message({ type: 'tick', count })
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
} while (count++ < 1000)
```

## `Pear.worker <Object>`

Pear Worker is used to spawn processes and facilitate communication between the parent and child processes in the Pear Runtime.

The spawned worker process inherits standard input, output, and error from the parent process.

A bidirectional pipe is also created which enables communication between the parent and worker process.

Reference counting is handled automatically to manage the sidecar lifecycle.

### `const pipe = Pear.worker.run(link <String>, args <Array<String>>)`

Runs a Pear Worker by spawning a Pear Terminal Application process from the specified `link` parameter. The Worker uses the flags of the parent application but any application arguments must be passed using the `args` parameter, the `args` parameter also sets `Pear.config.args`. Returns a pipe (a [`streamx`](https://github.com/mafintosh/streamx) `Duplex` stream) for Worker communication. 

### `const pipe = Pear.worker.pipe()`

Returns the pipe (a [`streamx`](https://github.com/mafintosh/streamx) `Duplex` stream) created to the worker process.

## `Pear.media <Object>`

Media interface

### `const status = await Pear.media.status.microphone()`

Resolves to: `<String>`

If access to the microphone is available, resolved value will be `'granted'`.

Any other string indicates lack of permission. Possible values are `'granted'`, `'not-determined'`, `'denied'`, `'restricted'`, `'unknown'`.

### `const status = await Pear.media.status.camera()`

Resolves to: `<String>`

If access to the camera is available, resolved value will be `'granted'`.

Any other string indicates lack of permission. Possible values are `'granted'`, `'not-determined'`, `'denied'`, `'restricted'`, `'unknown'`.

### `const status = await Pear.media.status.screen()`

Resolves to: `<String>`

If access to the screen is available, resolved value will be `'granted'`.

Any other string indicates lack of permission. Possible values are `'granted'`, `'not-determined'`, `'denied'`, `'restricted'`, `'unknown'`.

### `const success = await Pear.media.access.microphone()`

Resolves to: `<Boolean>`

Request access to the microphone. Resolves to `true` if permission is granted.

### `const success = await Pear.media.access.camera()`

Resolves to: `<Boolean>`

Request access to the camera. Resolves to `true` if permission is granted.

### `const success = await Pear.media.access.screen()`

Resolves to: `<Boolean>`

Request access to screen sharing. Resolves to `true` if permission is granted.

### `const sources = await Pear.media.desktopSources(options <Object>)`

Captures available desktop sources. Resolves to an array of objects with shape `{ id <String>, name <String>, thumbnail <NativeImage>, display_id <String>, appIcon <NativeImage> }`. The `id` is the window or screen identifier. The `name` is the window title or `'Screen <index>'` in multiscreen scenarios or else `Entire Screen`. The `display_id` identifies the screen. The thumbnail is a scaled down screen capture of the window/screen.

**Options**

* `types <Array<String>>` - Default: `['screen', 'window']`. Filter by types. Types are `'screen'` and `'window'`.
* `thumbnailSize <Object>` - Default: `{width: 150, height: 150}`. Set thumbnail scaling (pixels)
* `fetchWindowIcons <Boolean>` - Default: `false`. Populate `appIcon` with Window icons, or else `null`.

### `const path = Pear.media.getPathForFile(file <File>)`

Accepts a web [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/File) object and returns the file system path for that file as a `String`. In cases where the `file` argument is not a `File` object an exception is thrown. In the case that the `file` is constructed in JS and is not backed by a file on disk an empty string is returned.

Available in Desktop Applications only.

* https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/web-utils#webutilsgetpathforfilefile

### `Pear.versions <Async Function>`

Function that returns a promise which resolves to a Pear versions object with the shape `{ fork <Integer>, length <Integer>, key <Buffer> }`.

The `key` is a Buffer of the run key. The `length` is the size of the relevant Hypercore. The `fork` property is determined by data truncation.

These three properties together are a unique identifier for the entire state of both applications and the Pear platform.

### `Pear.versions.platform { fork <Integer>, length <Integer>, key <Buffer> }`

The platform version.

### `Pear.versions.app { fork <Integer>, length <Integer>, key <Buffer> }`

The application version.

### `Pear.versions.runtimes { bare <Integer>, electron <Integer>, pear <Integer> }`

**References**

* [Pear.config.key](#pearconfigkey-objectnull)


### `Pear.teardown(fn <Async Function|Function>)`

Register application clean-up handlers to be called when an application begins to unload.

May be called multiple times to register multiple teardown handlers.

Functions supplied to teardown will be executed in order of registration when
an application begins to unload. Any promise returned from each supplied function
will be waited upon until resolution before calling the next teardown handler.

### Pear.reload()

Refresh application in Desktop applications. Not available in terminal
applications.

### `Pear.restart()`

Restart the application. Desktop Applications only.

### `Pear.exit(code)`

Exits the process with the provided exit code.

### `Pear.updates(listener <Async Function|Function>) => streamx.Readable`

The `listener` function is called for every incoming update with an `update` object of the form:

```js
{
  type: 'pear/updates',
  version: { fork <Integer>, length <Integer>, key <String(hex)>,  } | null,
  app <Boolean>,
  diff <Array <String> >,
}
```

* `version` is a Pear version object holding incoming version information
* `app` indicates whether the update represents an application (`true`) or platform (`false`) update
* `diff` requires `--update-diffs` flag (else `null`). An array of objects of form `{ type, key}`.
  * `type` `<String>` - Operation type `update` or `delete`
  * `key` `<String>` - Drive key for a given updated file e.g. `/path/to/file.txt`

Also returns a [`streamx`](https://github.com/mafintosh/streamx) `Readable`) stream.

### `const update = await Pear.updated()`

Returns the current `update` object of the form:

```js
{
  version: { fork <Integer>, length <Integer>, key <String(hex)>,  } | null,
  app <Boolean>,
  diff <Array <String>>,
} | undefined
```

* `version` is a Pear version object holding incoming version information
* `app` indicates whether the update represents an application (`true`) or platform (`false`) update
* `diff` requires `--update-diffs` flag (else `null`). An array of objects of form `{ type, key}`.
  * `type` `<String>` - Operation type `update` or `delete`
  * `key` `<String>` - Drive key for a given updated file e.g. `/path/to/file.txt`

Returns `undefined` if the app hasn't updated since the application started.

### `Pear.wakeups(listener <Async Function|Function>) => streamx.Readable`

A wakeup occurs in the following cases:

* when a trusted `pear://` link is clicked and the application for that link is already open
* when used with `pear run --detached pear://<key>[/data]`

The `listener` function is called for every incoming wakeup with a `wakeup` object of the form:

```js
{
  type: 'pear/wakeup',
  link: <String>,
  linkData: <String>,
  fragment: <String>,
  entrypoint: <String>
}
```

* `link` is the `pear://` link for the application receiving the wakeup
* `linkData` is everything after the key in the `pear://` link - this would be `pathname` of a [`URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL) object but without the leading slash (`/`). Given `pear://8ts9yz9dtucxzwbxafygnjasqe9ti3dt3w7rm6sbiu8prmidacao/some/more/stuff` the `data` string would hold `some/more/stuff`.
* `fragment` is the `fragment` part of `pear://link#fragment` (location hash without the `#` prefix).
* `entrypoint` includes `entrypoint` of `pear://link/some/entry/point` (URL pathname).

Also returns a [`streamx`](https://github.com/mafintosh/streamx) `Readable`) stream.

### `Pear.badge(count <Integer|null>) => Promise<Boolean>`

Set the badge number for the application on desktop for Linux & MacOS. Setting the `count` to `0` will hide the badge while `null` will display a plain dot on MacOS only.

Returns a `Boolean` promise for whether the call succeeded.

Desktop Applications only.

### `Pear.tray(options <Object>, listener <Async Function|Function>) => Promise<untray()>`

Configure a tray icon for the application. This method will return a promise which resolves to an `untray()` function for removing the tray.

The `listener` function is triggered whenever a menu item or the tray icon is clicked. It receives a single argument `key` that represents the menu item `key` that was clicked or the special value of `'click'` for when the menu icon itself was clicked. If no `listener` function is provided, a default listener will show the application window when triggered with `'click'` or `'show'` and quits with `'quit'`.

A Pear application must be `hideable` to support adding a tray (see [`pear.gui.hideable`](./configuration.md#pear.gui.hideable-less-than-boolean-greater-than-default-false)).

WARNING: Linux tray support varies which can cause scenarios where the application's tray doesn't work and closing the app will be hidden and inaccessible. Using a tray and `hideable` on Linux is not recommended.

Desktop Applications only.

**Options**

* `icon <String>` Default: The Pear icon - The path for icon for the tray
  relative to the project root. Supported formats: PNG & JPEG
* `menu <Object>` Default: ``{ show: `Show ${Pear.config.name}`, quit: 'Quit' }`` - The

  `listener` and whose value is the text displayed in the menu.
* `os <Object>` Default: `{ win32: true, linux: true, darwin: true  }` - which
  platforms support using the tray menu. The platform is checked via the
  `process.platform` value.

## Web APIs

Most [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) will work as-is.

This section details deviations in behavior from and notable aspects of Web APIs as they relate to Pear.

### `window.open`

The [`window.open`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) Web API function will ignore all arguments except for the URL parameter.

In browsers, `window.open` opens a new browser window. The opened window belongs to the same browser from which `window.open` is called.

In Pear, `window.open` loads the URL in the **default system browser**. It does *not* create a new application window (use `Pear.Window` to create application windows).

Therefore Pear's `window.open` only supports a single URL argument. The `target` and `windowFeatures` parameters that browsers support are discarded.

### Scripts and Modules

Like browsers, there is no support for CommonJS (e.g. the `require` function as used by Node.js is not supported in Pear Applications).

Like browsers, there is support for native EcmaScript Modules (ESM). A JavaScript Script has no module capabilities. A JavaScript Module has ESM capabilities.

Use `<script type="module" src="path/to/my-file.js">` to load a JavaScript Module.

Use `<script src="path/to/my-file.js">` to load a JavaScript Script.
